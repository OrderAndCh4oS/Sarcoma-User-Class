# Sarcoma Users Class
This is a PHP User authentication class. It doesn't do anything special, and I'm sure there are better ways of doing it, but this does what I need to to do. If you think you can do better you're probably be right, so feel free to send pull requests.

## Install

Via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

```bash
$ composer require sarcoma/users
```

Requires PHP 5.5.0 or newer.
